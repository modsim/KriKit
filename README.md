# Kriging toolKit

The Kriging toolKit (KriKit) is developed at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1 (IBG-1) of Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (FZJ) under supervision of Lars Freier and Dr. Eric von Lieres.

KriKit allows the user to apply Kriging on all kind of problems. Kriging is an interpolation method commonly applied in empirical modeling for approximating functional relationships between impact factors and system response. The interpolation is based on a statistical analysis of given data and can optionally include a priori defined trend functions.

KriKit is implemented in Matlab(2015b) and can be used either via command line or via a user friendly GUI. KriKit is freely distributed (under the terms of the GPLv3) as a contribution to the scientific community. If you find it useful for your own work, we would appreciate acknowledgements of the KriKit software.
