% TERNPLOT plot ternary phase diagram
%   TERNPLOT(A, B) plots ternary phase diagram for three components.  C is calculated
%      as 1 - A - B.
%
%   TERNPLOT(A, B, C) plots ternary phase data for three components A B and C.  If the values 
%       are not fractions, the values are normalised by dividing by the total.
%
%   TERNPLOT(A, B, C, LINETYPE) the same as the above, but with a user specified LINETYPE (see PLOT
%       for valid linetypes).
%   
%   NOTES
%   - An attempt is made to keep the plot close to the default plot type.  The code has been based largely on the
%     code for POLAR.       
%   - The regular TITLE and LEGEND commands work with the plot from this function, as well as incrimental plotting
%     using HOLD.  Labels can be placed on the axes using TERNLABEL
%
